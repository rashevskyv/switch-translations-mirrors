========================================

Thank you for selecting our NX-Translation pack. This guide will lead you through the process of installing a custom translation for your firmware. Please adhere to the steps below:

1. **SELECT A STOCK FIRMWARE LANGUAGE TO REPLACE**
   
   The first step is to choose a language from your current firmware to replace with the custom translation. Take note that this choice is pivotal as games will still use this replaced language. Hence, select a language that you are comfortable using in your games.

2. **COPY THE CONTENTS OF THE SELECTED CONTENTS**

   Open the selected contents subfolder and copy all its contents, including any files and other subfolders present inside.

4. **ACCESS THE SDCARD/ATMOSPHERE/ DIRECTORY**

   Insert your SD card into your computer and navigate to the "SDCARD/atmosphere/contents" folder. If the folder does not exist, create it.

5. **TRANSFER THE COPIED FILES**

   Paste all the files and subfolders that you copied in step 2 into the "SDCARD/atmosphere/contents" folder on your SD card.

6. **SAFELY REMOVE THE SD CARD**

   Once the transfer process is complete, ensure to safely eject the SD card from your computer to avoid any potential data corruption.

7. **REINSERT THE SD CARD INTO YOUR DEVICE**

   Now, reinsert the SD card back into your device.

**NOTE**:
- Utilize the custom translation at your own risk as we cannot assure full compatibility with all firmware versions or game titles.
